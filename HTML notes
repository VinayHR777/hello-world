Encoding type for HTML page while saving the file is UTF-8. Extension can be .htm or .html
-------------------------
A simple HTML document:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. 
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the document. 
The <title> element specifies a title for the document
The <body> element contains the visible page content
-------------------------------
element:
An element in HTML represents some kind of structure or semantics and generally consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. 
The following is a paragraph element:
<p>
This is the content of the paragraph element.
</p>
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
-----------------------------
<head> element:
The most common elements found in the <head> tag are: <title>, <meta>, <link> and <script> tags.
-------------------------------
<meta> element:
The HTML <meta> tag contains information or metadata that is not directly visible on the web page, but is used by browsers and 
search engines.

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<meta name="description" content="The HTML meta tag is an element that resides within the HTML head tag.">
<meta name="keywords" content="html, meta, tag, element">
<meta name="author" content="www.techonthenet.com">
<title>HTML 5 Example by www.techonthenet.com</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
In this HTML 5 Document example, we have created 5 meta tags. The first meta tag (charset) defines the character 
encoding for the HTML document. The second meta tag (viewport) is used when designing a responsive web site.
A <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device 
(which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
The third meta tag (description) provides a description for the web page for the search engines.
The fourth meta tag (keywords) provides keywords for the search engines. 
The final meta tag (author) defines the author of the web page.
------------------------------------------
<link> element:
The <link> tag defines a link between a document and an external resource.
The <link> tag is used to link to external style sheets.
for example,
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="theme.css">
</head>
-----------------------------------------
<script> element:
The HTML <script> tag is used to embed or reference a client-side script such as JavaScript. 
There are two ways that you can use the <script> tag. You can either embed the code within the <script> tags or 
you can reference a file that includes the code.

Embedded Code:
<script type="text/javascript">
  client-side scripting goes here ...
</script>

Reference a File:
<script src="/js/functions.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
---------------------------------------------
HTML Headings:
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
<h1> is the biggest and <h6> is the smallest.
for example,
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
-------------------------------------
<p> element:
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.'enter' in the paragraph will be considered as single space in the browser.
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

HTML Attributes:
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about an element
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
for example,
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>. Here href is an attribute.
<p style="color:red">I am a paragraph</p>. Here style is an attribute.
<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>. Here title is an attribute.

---------------------------------
<br> element:
<br> element defines a line break.
---------------------------------
<pre> Element:

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>
----------------------------------------
The HTML Style Attribute:
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.
It has the following syntax:
<tagname style="property:value;">
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value.

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
For example2,
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>
